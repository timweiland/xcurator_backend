* xCurator backend
Welcome! This is the repository for the backend of the [[https://www.landesmuseum.de/museum/forschung-projekte/kuenstliche-intelligenz-museum][xCurator]].

** Tech stack
- General: [[https://www.djangoproject.com/][Django]], [[https://www.django-rest-framework.org/][DRF]]
- Auth: [[https://github.com/jazzband/djangorestframework-simplejwt][djangorestframework-simplejwt]]
- Database: SQLite
  + Temporarily - it's just easier for development
  + Eventually, we should switch to Postgres!

** Requirements
- Python 3
- [[https://pypi.org/project/pip/][pip]]

** Development
- [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html][Create a virtual environment]] and activate it
- Run =pip install -r requirements.txt= to install the dependencies
  + On Debian/Ubuntu, you are advised to install the following packages which will install, directly or by dependency, the required geospatial libraries for the       GeoDjango framework: =$ sudo apt-get install binutils libproj-dev gdal-bin=
- Copy =.env.dev.example= to =.env=, change values as you see fit
- Run =python manage.py migrate= to create/update the DB
- Run =python manage.py createsuperuser= to create an admin account
- Run =python manage.py runserver= to start the server
- Please use a code formatter before committing.
  + I run [[https://github.com/psf/black][black]] automatically on each save
    - TODO: We should add a pre-commit hook for this at some point

** Importing data
*** Baden State Museum data
[[file:scripts/transform_to_unqualified_dc.ipynb][scripts/transform_to_unqualified_dc.ipynb]] can be used to transform data from the Baden State Museum to a .zip that contains
 - a file called =dc.json= containing the museum object metadata
 - a directory called =images= that contains the images associated with the objects

This .zip can be imported into the backend using the command =python manage.py import_dc --zip-path <zip_path>=
